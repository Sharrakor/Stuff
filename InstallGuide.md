# Installation of Tick for a Development/Testing Environment

This is a brief list of instructions to make the setting up of a development or testing environment linearly simple.

1. First thing's first: ensure that you have a working copy of Unity installed on your machine. If you have not done so already, go to [unity.com](http://www.unity.com). You may use any version of Unity as you wish, though any version earlier or later than version 4.0.1f2 may introduce compatibility errors.

2. Next, go to the [Tick repository](https://github.com/swin-sep/Team-04-Tick) and either select to download the master zip file (see the right hand side of the page) and unzip it where you please or clone the repo with the provided url(s).
Feel free to rename the containing folder anything you wish, assuming you placed the cloned repo inside one; however, it's recommended to leave the internal folders as they are.

3. ~~(Go to the [dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Game%20Project%202%20-%20%20Tick) and download the Unity package from [Wherever it is])~~

4. ???

5. Profit!
