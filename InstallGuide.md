# Installation of Tick for a Development/Testing Environment

This is a brief list of instructions to make the setting up of a development or testing environment linearly simple.

1. First thing's first: ensure that you have a working copy of Unity installed on your machine. If you have not done so already, download version 4.0.1f2 here: [unity.com](http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/UnitySetup-4.0.1.exe). You, of course, may use any version of Unity as you wish, though any version earlier or later than this version may introduce compatibility errors.
2. Next, download the latest master zip file of the [Tick repository](https://github.com/swin-sep/Team-04-Tick/archive/master.zip) and extract it to any folder of your choosing.
Feel free to rename the containing folder anything you wish, assuming you placed the cloned repo inside one; however, it's recommended to leave the internal folders as they are.
3. Download the Unity package from [this here dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0s7yghtyafynut/UnofficialTickArtPackage.unitypackage).
**Warning: this is not currently an "official" art asset package. Some caution is recommended when building levels from it.**
Save it to any location you like.
4. Open up Unity and, from the Assets menu, select `Import Package` > `Custom Package...`. From the dialog box, select the Unity Package you just downloaded and import it. You'll likely want to import all the items so go ahead and simply click `import` on the following box to continue. (Of course, you can alternatively select what items you want to import by checking and unchecking boxes as needed.)
5. From here, you can either create a new scene or open a pre-existing one (such as the Benchmarking scene, which will be included in the Unity package soon).
